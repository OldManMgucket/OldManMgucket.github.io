<title> My Love For Hollow Knight Silksong </title>

<h1 style="color:crimson;"> Why Hollow Knight Silksong is an Amazing Game </h1>
<h2> The Beauty of Settings </h2>
<p> 
All of the settings are beautiful considering the fact that Team Cherry was restricted to a 2D space. The detail in the backgrounds is astounding. Individuals such as Siwon Kim, Balasanjay Balamurugan, and I all love the well crafted settings. Regions such as the Marrow, Deep Docks, the Citadel, and more all demonstrate the love that Team Cherry dumped into the game.
</p>
<h3> The Brutal Difficulty </h3>
<p> The <i>brutal</i> difficulty of Silksong truly immerses you into this world. The world around you is cruel, and every moment of sucess is a surge of euphoria. Every hard boss that is defeated fills you with happiness. Every hard dungeon conquered is a moment of joy. Every hard region that you go through makes you feel successful. Like other hard games such as Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, Elden Ring, Celeste, and the original Hollow Knight, difficulty is used as a tool for learning for the most part. Difficulty in games teaches us to be strong. The only way you can lose in games is when you give up. These games want you to win, you just need the willpower to go on. </p>
<h2> Fun </h2>
<p> The combat is <strong> very </strong> fun. The bosses are fun. <em> Most </em> enemies are fun. Exploration is fun. The game in general is fun.
