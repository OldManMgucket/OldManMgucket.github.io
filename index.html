<h1 style="color:crimson;"> Why Hollow Knight Silksong is an Amazing Game </h1>
  <p> <i> Spoilers Ahead </i></p>
<h2> The Beauty of Settings </h2>
<p> 
All of the settings are beautiful considering the fact that Team Cherry was restricted to a 2D space. The detail in the backgrounds is astounding. For example, there is a fountain found in the Citadel that is in the background. It is extremely detailed and it is obvious that Team Cherry spent a long time creating it, and most players will just run past it. A fact that makes this even more interesting is that nearly everything in the game is hand drawn. Many people love the well crafted settings. Regions such as the Marrow, Deep Docks, the Citadel, and more all demonstrate the love that Team Cherry dumped into the game.

<h3> The Brutal Difficulty </h3>
<p> The <i>brutal</i> difficulty of Silksong truly immerses you into this world. The world around you is cruel, and every moment of sucess is a surge of euphoria. Every hard boss that is defeated fills you with happiness. Every hard dungeon conquered is a moment of joy. Every hard region that you go through makes you feel successful. Like other hard games such as Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, Elden Ring, Celeste, and the original Hollow Knight, difficulty is used as a tool for learning for the most part. Difficulty in games teaches us to be strong. The only way you can lose in games is when you give up. These games want you to win, you just need the willpower to go on. </p>

<h2> Fun </h2>
<p> The combat is <strong> very </strong> fun. The bosses are fun. <em> Most </em> enemies are fun. Exploration is fun. The game in general is fun. Team Cherry mastered the balance of difficulty and fun. Bosses such as Widow, Trobbio, the Cogwork Dancers, and the Last Judge all have fun movesets that are very satisfying to dodge. This game surpasses the original in fun, atmosphere and difficulty. Hollow Knight Silksong has been my favorite game to come out in recent years and I highly recommend it.
